Resistance identification

Objective:
This project will display the resistance of any resistor workout checking the colored lines ok the resistor.
For this project we are going to work on Arduino technology.

Requirement Engineering:
From this project we expect to have these results:
1.	Real time measurement of resistance
2.	Display the results on LCD
3.	Affordable budget
4.	Keeping the hardware safe from outside environment

Circuit:
Extra file with the circuit diagram is attached.

Materials required:
1.	Arduino Uno
2.	Power supply(Battery)
3.	LCD Display
4.	Breadboard
5.	Resistors
6.	Jumper wires
